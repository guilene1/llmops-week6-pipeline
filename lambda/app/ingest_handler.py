"""The ingestion Lambda: load -> chunk -> embed -> store, for every policy file.

When it runs (set up in terraform/ingestion_triggers.tf):
  - whenever manifest.json is uploaded to the documents bucket
    (upload the documents first, then the manifest, so it runs once)
  - once a day, on a schedule

From your machine:  python -m app.ingest_handler   (reads the data/documents folder)

The order here matters. Everything that can be checked for free is checked
before anything is embedded or written:

  1. the manifest agrees with the folder, and every label is one we recognise
  2. every document produces at least one chunk
  3. only then is the old index dropped and rebuilt

A failure in step 1 or 2 leaves the running index exactly as it was, so a bad
upload cannot take policy search down while somebody works out what went wrong.
