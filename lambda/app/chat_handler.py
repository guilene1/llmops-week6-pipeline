"""The chat API: one Lambda function behind Amazon API Gateway.

API Gateway checks the Cognito token BEFORE this code runs. A request without a
valid token never reaches us. API Gateway then passes the token's claims in the
event, so the signed-in email comes from there: never from the request body,
never from a header the browser could fake.

Routes (defined in terraform/api_gateway.tf):

    GET  /api/health                             no sign-in needed
    GET  /api/me                                 who is signed in
    GET  /api/conversations                      their chats
    GET  /api/conversations/{id}/messages        one chat, if it's theirs
    POST /api/chat                               ask a question
