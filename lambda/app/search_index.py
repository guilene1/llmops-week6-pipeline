"""Store and search policy chunks in Amazon OpenSearch Serverless.

The project this grew out of stored its chunks in pgvector, inside a Postgres
container that held nothing else: no employee records, no identity, one datastore.
The assistant answered from policy documents and said plainly that it could not see
anyone's personal record.

Two things change here, and it is worth keeping them apart:

  - The chunks move to OpenSearch Serverless, which is this file.
  - Employee records arrive for the first time, in Aurora, behind row-level
    security. That is new work, not a migration of something that existed.

Both are protected, and not in the same way, which is the reason they sit in
different services. A policy document carries one access level for the whole
document, and that filter is applied inside the vector search. An employee record
is protected row by row, by a rule Postgres evaluates from the org chart. One
coarse label on a chunk, one per row policy in the database: neither mechanism
substitutes for the other.

Two more things worth knowing about this file:

  - A NextGen OpenSearch Serverless collection chooses the vector engine itself.
    Our vectors are normalized, so "inner product" gives the same ranking as cosine
    similarity, and the collection scales to zero OCUs when nobody is asking anything.
  - Every request is signed with the Lambda's IAM role ("aoss" is OpenSearch
    Serverless). There is no password.
